    "# Movie portal game\n",
    "We have developed a Movie Game! The story is about Indiana Jones who was running toward the Temple of Doom when a mysterious portal suddenly appeared, pulling him into another dimension. Now he is trapped and needs your help to return to the real world! To do so, you must complete four game worlds based on famous movies, where you can earn portal pieces along the way. Collect all four, and you can help Indiana Jones to escape back to the real world!\n",
    "\n",
    "The four game worlds are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* World 1: Inspired by Rapunzel: can you escape the tower and help Rapunzel find the floating latterns?\n",
    "* World 2: Inspired by Alice in Wonderland\n",
    "* World 3: ?\n",
    "* World 4: Inspired by Jumanji: find your path through the jungle, be careful since there is a thin line between risk and reward!\n",
    "Are you ready for the adventure?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source \n",
    "The fighting game in the first world was inspired by a github repository (source: https://github.com/orkslayergamedev/python-classes-text-battle/tree/master and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM_ocyOrs_k). This code was implemented and edited to fit into the fighting scene.\n",
