#The fighting game in the first world was inspired by a github repository (source: https://github.com/orkslayergamedev/python-classes-text-battle/tree/master and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM_ocyOrs_k). This code was implemented and edited to fit into the fighting scene.

# ------------ Import ------------

# ------------ Set up ------------

# Call os' system method with an empty command (in case console doesn't print colors properly)
os.system("")
